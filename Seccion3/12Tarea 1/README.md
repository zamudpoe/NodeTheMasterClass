The Assignment:

Please create a simple "**_Hello World_**" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a **_RESTful JSON API_** that listens on a port of your choice.
1. When someone posts anything to the route _/hello_, you should return a welcome message, in **_JSON format_**. This message can be anything you want.
